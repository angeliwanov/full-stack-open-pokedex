Jest and Vitest are among the most commonly used testing frameworks designed to ensure correctness of any JS code base. Vitest is compatible with most of the Jest API. That means that most tests developed for Jest can also be executed using Vitest, with few if any changes needed.

Webpack is probably the most well-known module bundler. Vite popularity has increased significantly during the last years and has become the preferred building tool for many developers.
